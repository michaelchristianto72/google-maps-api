    "description": "The Merlion is the official mascot of Singapore. It is depicted as a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish. Being of prominent symbolic nature to Singapore and Singaporeans in general, it is widely used to represent both the city state and its people in sports teams, advertising, branding, tourism and as a national personification. The Merlion was first used in Singapore as the logo for the tourism board. Its name combines \"mer\", meaning the sea, and \"lion\". The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which means \"sea town\" in Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore's original name—Singapura—meaning \"lion city\" or \"kota singa\"",
